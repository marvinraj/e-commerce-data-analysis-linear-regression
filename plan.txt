steps to analyse data --
    1. Exploratory Data Analysis (eda)
        a. data understanding
        b. data preparation/cleaning
        c. feature understanding (univariate analysis)
        d. feature relationships (bivariate analysis)
        e. correlation analysis
    2. Linear Regression Analysis
        a. steps for linear regression analysis
            1. split data into training and testing sets
            2. normalize the dataset
            3. build linear regression model
            4. train the model
            5. evaluate linear regression model
            6. visualize the results
