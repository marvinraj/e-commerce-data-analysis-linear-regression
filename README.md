## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce data to gain insights into customer behavior and predict future trends using linear regression. The main goal is to build a predictive model that helps understand customer spending patterns on mobile apps and websites.

Key Learning Outcomes:
-   Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on e-commerce data.
-   Building a **Linear Regression** model to forecast customer behavior.
-   Visualizing data to extract meaningful insights.
-   Gaining hands-on experience with regression analysis and data visualization techniques.


## Why This Project?
-   Improve skills in **Linear Regression** analysis.
-   Learn the art of **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis).
-   Enhance my ability to **visualize data** and **interpret** it from charts/graphs.
-   Practice reading and extracting insights from **data visualizations**.

## My Plan to Execute This Project
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    -   Data Understanding
    -   Data Cleaning and Preparation
    -   Univariate Analysis (Understanding individual features)
    -   Bivariate Analysis (Feature relationships)
    -   Correlation Analysis
    
-   **Linear Regression Analysis**:
    -   Split data into training and testing sets.
    -   Normalize the dataset.
    -   Build and train the linear regression model.
    -   Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
    -   Visualize the results.

## How to Run the Notebook
